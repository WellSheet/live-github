# Live Github

Live Github tries to bridge the gap between Github Pull Requests and Slack. It makes it easy to create a dedicated channel from a Github Pull Request. It pulls in all the reviewers so that you can get answers quicker than Github comments allow

Live Github was created during the 2021 Summer Hackathon at Wellsheet

# Live Github

At Wellsheet we found ourselves wanting a way to quickly collaborate on Pull Requests in ways the Github Comments weren't designed for. Real time communication using them was hard, and we often found ourselves missing comments from our peers since we weren't constantly refreshing the page.

**Live Github was created to solve this problem**

Live Github tries to bridge the gap between Github Pull Requests and Slack. It makes it easy to create a dedicated channel from a Github Pull Request. It pulls in all the reviewers so that you can get answers quicker than Github comments allow!
To not clog up your Slack channels list, this new channel will be automatically archived when the Pull Request is closed ðŸŽ‰

Live Github was created during the 2021 Summer Hackathon at Wellsheet
